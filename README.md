#Space Game

What I am trying to create here is a space based game inspired by classics
such as Sid Meiers Civilization and the MMORPG OGame.  I am trying to use
the core concepts and mechanics from OGame while introducing the depth
and customisability of the Civilization games.

In the end the goal is to have a browser based, timer oriented, 4x game.

If you would like to contribute, I would be happy to have the help.

I would recommend reading the INSTALL.md file and the LICENSE.md file to get
started.
